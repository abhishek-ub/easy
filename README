Easy code project initialization, navigation, and execution

This repo contains a few useful scripts for creating, navigating, building, and
executing code projects. These scripts are most handy when they are executed
using shell aliases. The aliases you'll need to include in your .bashrc (or
other initialization file, depending on your shell) are included in the file
"ADD_TO_RC". Once you've added the aliases (and edited them so that they include
paths to this directory and not "<path-to-this-directory>") the workflow is as
follows:

1) ip

The "ip" command allows a user to initialize the current working directory to
a code project. The script currently only allows users to select from either a
Java, C, or C++ project but can easily be extended to include other languages.
The script copies over the contents of the java, c, or c++ directory (depending
on language selection), including the necessary Makefile and project
directories.

2) src, doc, obj, bin

The "src", "doc", "obj", and "bin" commands allow the user to instantly switch
to any of those directories from anywhere within the code project. Again, this
is easily extensible to include other directories as each user sees fit.

3) m, mc, r (and rv)

The "m" command allows a user to make the project from any subdirectory of the
code project, including the root. The "mc" command performs the make clean
operation. Once a project is compiled, the "r" command runs the executable
binary file. The "rv" command (C only) allows a user to run an executable with
Valgrind.
